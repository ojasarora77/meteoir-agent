# Project Development Memories

## Project Setup and Initial Development
- Initialized agentic-stablecoin project repository
- Set up basic project structure for an agentic stablecoin implementation
- Began exploring architectural concepts for a decentralized stablecoin system

## Technical Exploration
- Investigated agent-based approaches to stablecoin stability mechanisms
- Researched potential smart contract designs for autonomous stabilization
- Explored interaction models between different agent types in the stablecoin ecosystem

## Key Discussions and Decisions
- Considered various algorithmic approaches to maintaining price stability
- Evaluated potential agent roles in the stablecoin economic model
- Discussed decentralized governance and economic incentive structures
