# Autonomous AI Agent for Stablecoin Payments

## 🎯 Project Overview

An autonomous AI agent that intelligently manages and executes stablecoin payments for services (APIs, cloud, subscriptions) across multiple blockchains without human intervention. The agent combines REI Network's zero-fee transactions with ICP's on-chain AI capabilities to create the first truly autonomous cross-chain payment system.

### Core Components

#### 1. AI Decision Engine (ICP Canister)
- **Cost Optimization Algorithm**: Analyzes service pricing and quality metrics
- **Usage Prediction Model**: Forecasts resource needs based on historical data
- **Negotiation Logic**: Automatically switches between service providers
- **Risk Assessment**: Monitors service reliability and adjusts strategies

#### 2. Payment Execution Layer (REI Network)
- **Smart Payment Controller**: Manages budgets and approval thresholds
- **Service Provider Registry**: Maintains database of available APIs/services
- **Multi-Token Support**: Handles USDC, USDT, and other stablecoins

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

#### ICP Canister (Rust/Motoko)
```rust
// Pseudo-code structure
struct AutonomousAgent {
    decision_engine: AIModel,
    service_database: ServiceRegistry,
    performance_metrics: HashMap<ServiceId, Metrics>,
    user_preferences: UserConfig,
}

impl AutonomousAgent {
    fn analyze_service_need(&self, request: ServiceRequest) -> Decision;
    fn optimize_costs(&self, options: Vec<ServiceOption>) -> ServiceOption;
    fn execute_cross_chain_payment(&self, payment: PaymentRequest);
    fn update_models(&mut self, feedback: ServiceFeedback);
}
```

#### REI Network Contracts (Solidity)
```solidity
contract PaymentController {
    mapping(address => Budget) public budgets;
    mapping(address => ServiceProvider) public providers;
    
    struct Budget {
        uint256 dailyLimit;
        uint256 monthlyLimit;
        uint256 currentSpent;
        uint256 approvalThreshold;
    }
    
    function executePayment(
        address provider,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata serviceData
    ) external onlyAuthorizedAgent;
    
    function addServiceProvider(
        address provider,
        string memory apiEndpoint,
        uint256 costPerCall
    ) external;
}
```

        this.provider = provider;
        this.pricing = pricing;
        this.auth = authentication;
    }
    
    async callService(data) {
        // Execute payment
        await this.paymentController.executePayment(
            this.provider.address,
            this.calculateCost(data),
            data
        );
        
        // Make API call
        return await this.provider.api.call(data);
    }
}
```
